## Credit Card Fraud Background

According to annual report from the industry research firm [Nilson Report](https://nilsonreport.com/upload/content_promo/NilsonReport_Issue1209.pdf), actual losses experienced by issuers, merchants and acquirers exceed the $28.58 billion lost globally last year [2021] and can’t be accurately calculated, the report noted, because there are additional expenses related to fraud investigation, managing call centers and maintaining operations, which tend to rise annually.

This project has he the main purpose of build step-by-step a simple but robust detection fraud model using a real public credit card transaction database. In the project it's clear the trade-off presence in every model and also the error involved, which can be properly defined by the business purpose and key performance indicators (KPI) from the business.
